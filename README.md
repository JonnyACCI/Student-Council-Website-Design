# Campbell-SAC
I made this website using HTML CSS JS for Albert Campbell Collegiate Institute's Student Activity Council.

### Summary
The website has four distinct sections:
1. **The home page**
2. **SAC-related forms page**
3. **Members Page**
4. **Contact page**

More sections will be added as necessary. For instance, when events come up, specific pages can be made for said events.
Once a logo is finalized, it can be added to the site.

### Home Page
